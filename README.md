# Tabular-Compete-2

Here is my notebook from this competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2022


It gave me 963/1255 place which very bad result. The reason for it is a difference in train and test datasets. After I created my approach I walkthrough popular Kaggle notebooks and found out that my way of solving this problem didn't claim good results and it should be redone. But in the end, I decided to leave this approach unchanged, as a reminder of the need for more serious data analysis before moving on to ensemble methods.
